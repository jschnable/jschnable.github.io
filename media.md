<p>2016, August "<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.aag1125">Integration of omic networks in a developmental atlas of maize</a>" led by Steve Briggs at UCSD and Justin Walley at ISU, is published in the journal Science. The Schnable lab's contribution to this paper focused on using data from multiple grass species to predict which genes will produce both RNA and protein and which genes will produce only RNA which is not translated into protein.
