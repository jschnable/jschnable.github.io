Harshita Mangal from India is a PhD student in the Department of Agronomy and Horticulture. Her research focuses on dissecting complex traits in Sorghum bicolor, with a primary focus on flowering time regulation and nitrogen use efficiency. She works at the intersection of field-based phenotyping, genomics, and computational biology, integrating resequencing data, RNA-seq, and multi-environment field trials.
Harshita has led genome-wide (GWAS) and transcriptome-wide (TWAS) association studies to uncover genetic signals underlying key agronomic traits. She is currently working on modeling phenotypic plasticity, identifying regulatory networks through co-expression analysis, and validating SNP datasets for genotype accuracy across large populations.
