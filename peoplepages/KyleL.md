Kyle Linders joined the Schnable Lab in 2020 as an undergraduate assistant and moved into the
Integrated Plant Biology M.S. program in 2021 under Brandi Sigmon, where he studied the
quantitative genetics of sorghum panicle architecture. He completed the degree in 2023 and
continued as a Research Technologist I supporting maize and sorghum genetics field experiments
for the group through the summer of 2025.

Kyle holds a B.S. in Plant Biology (Biotechnology) and an M.S. in Agronomy (Plant Breeding and
Genetics), both from UNL, and now serves as a Research Agronomist with PivotBio. He brings
expertise in protocol development and has implemented quality control procedures to ensure
consistent, high-quality datasets are provided for genomic/transcriptomic analyses. His
contributions have strengthened multi-environment trials and supported ongoing efforts to
identify genetic variants associated with key agronomic traits.
