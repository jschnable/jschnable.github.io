Charlie Colvin joined the Schnable Lab in summer 2025 as an undergraduate researcher through the Crop-to-Food Innovation REEU Program. His work focuses on analyzing RNA-seq data from large-scale abiotic stress experiments in maize to understand genotype-by-environment interactions. He contributes to ongoing efforts to identify gene expression-based predictors of grain yield, flowering time, and plant height, as well as supporting data processing for high-throughput field experiments.
Charlie is completing his B.S. in Plant Sciences with honors at Penn State University, where his research has explored how maize flavonoids influence insect gut microbiomes, with applications in sustainable pest management. He has received multiple national awards recognizing his contributions to plant science, including the 2025 Astronaut Scholarship and the 2024 Proven WinnersÂ® Ushio Sakazaki Plant Breeding Scholarship.
