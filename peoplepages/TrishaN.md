On a mission to transform how the world grows food â€” smarter, faster, and sustainably. I am a final-year undergraduate student pursuing a B.Sc. in Agriculture in India, currently interning at the Department of Agronomy and Horticulture at the University of Nebraska, Lincoln under the mentorship of Dr. James Schnable. My interests lie at the intersection of agriculture, automation, and data-driven technologies. Through hands-on research and interdisciplinary collaborations, I aim to contribute to the development of sustainable and smart agricultural systems.
