Lina joined the research group of Dr. James Schnable in June 2022 as a Research Technologist. She completed her master's degree in Agricultural and Natural Resource Management where she specialized in population genetics, working with wild species to explore genetic interactions based on biotic and abiotic factors. Her undergraduate degree was in agricultural engineering from the University of Guadalajara, Mexico. In addition, she gained experience as a research assistant, working on the establishment of in vitro tissue cultures of the raspberry plant in adult individuals. She experimented with genetic transformation using bacteria in Agave and Tobacco cultivation, as well as genetic transformation with CRISPR-cas9. She developed a set of high molecular weight DNA extractions for GBS sequencing for 6 different crops and numerous species within crops (vanilla, bean, agave, raspberry, papaya, and avocado). As well as RNA for the generation of transcriptomes.
