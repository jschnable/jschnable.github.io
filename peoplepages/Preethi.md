Preethi J.K. joined the Schnable Lab in the summer of 2025 as a research intern in the Department of Agriculture and Horticulture, under the supervision of Waqar Ali. She is a final-year undergraduate student from India, majoring in agriculture. Her work involves high-throughput genomic analyses as part of two major projects: “Comparative genomics of Rice Ecotypes” and “Genetic Dissection of Yield Component Traits in Maize.” She is primarily engaged in SNPs calling, genome-wide association studies (GWAS), and candidate gene mapping using large-scale NGS datasets to uncover the genetic architecture underlying complex agronomic traits.
