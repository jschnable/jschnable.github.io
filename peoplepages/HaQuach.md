Ha Quach is a high-school intern in the Schnable Lab, investigating how a single allele triggers contrasting flowering responses in maize—promoting early flowering in Nebraska, but delayed flowering in Michigan. This work provides a striking example of genotype × environment interaction at a specific locus, shedding light on how the same gene variant can lead to dramatically different outcomes across environments.
