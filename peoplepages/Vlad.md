Dr. Vladimir Torres is a Research Assistant Professor at the University of Nebraskaâ€“Lincoln. His work integrates large-scale RNA-Seq and phenotypic datasets from over 850 sorghum lines, 700 maize lines, and 500 soybean lines adapted to different environmental regions, aiming to identify genes that regulate key traits like flowering time and plant height. He develops and applies bioinformatics pipelines in R and Python, combining tools and comparative genomics approaches to enhance gene discovery across species using orthologs. His methodology has uncovered biologically meaningful candidate genes that single-species analyses often miss.
In his current role, Dr. Torres co-supervises a team focused on gene validation through tissue culture, transformation, and gene editing in maize and sorghum.
