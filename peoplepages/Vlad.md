Vladimir joined the Schnable lab in October 2021 as a postdoctoral scholar, since then he has being working with machine learning and quantitative genetic techniques to predict and associate genes (from gene expression) with a phenotype; currently, he is also vice-president of the student's organization CROPS (Collective Research Organization of Plant Scientists). He obtained his PhD in Plant Biotechnology from LANGEBIO-CINVESTAV, Mexico; there he gained experience doing maize crosses, collecting phenotypes in the field and greenhouse, and working with gene expression data (RNA-Seq and RT-PCR). Earlier, he did his master characterizing a near isogenic line between B73 and Teosinte (parviglumis) and looking for root modification under low phosphorus conditions. He did his B.S. in food science at the University of Chapingo, Mexico.
