Prof. James Schnable is the Nebraska Corn Checkoff Presidential Chair at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. His research group focuses on integrating new technologies and capabilities from engineering, computer science, and statistics into maize and sorghum genetic and genomic research.

James received the [Marcus Rhoades Early Career Award for Maize Genetics in 2018](https://www.maizegdb.org/community/awards/maize_past_winners), the [North American Plant Phenotyping Network Early Career Award in 2019](http://nappn.plant-phenotyping.org/early-career-award-2019/), and the [American Society of Plant Biologists Early Career Award in 2019](https://blog.aspb.org/aspb-names-2019-award-recipients/).

James has founded three companies: [Data2Bio](https://www.data2bio.com/) (focused on genotyping and breeding decision support), [Dryland Genetics](http://www.drylandgenetics.com/) (breeding naturally water use efficient crops), and [EnGeniousAg](https://www.engeniousag.com/) (low cost nondestructive nutrient and water sensors for farmers), and he serves as a consultant or advisor to the scientific advisory boards of a number of larger companies in the agricultural and genomics sectors.

James holds a BA in Biology from Cornell University (2008) and a PhD in Plant Biology from UC-Berkeley (2012). From 2013 to 2014 he was an NSF Plant Genome Fellowship-supported postdoctoral scholar at the Danforth Center in St. Louis and the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences in Beijing, China.
