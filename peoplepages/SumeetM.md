Sumeet Mankar is a Postdoctoral Research Associate at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln in the Schnable Lab. He earned his Ph.D. in Plant Breeding and Genetics from Texas A&M University, where his doctoral research focused on integrating quantitative genetics and genomics to dissect complex agronomic traits. Prior to joining UNL, he was a Research Scientist at the Donald Danforth Plant Science Center, where he worked in an interdisciplinary environment combining functional genomics, high-throughput phenomics, and data science for crop improvement.

At the Schnable Lab, Sumeet is involved in large-scale, high-throughput phenotyping projects spanning field-based platforms. His research centers on integrating advanced phenotyping, GWAS, and multi-omics approaches to better understand the genetic architecture of complex traits related to yield, stress resilience, and crop adaptation.
