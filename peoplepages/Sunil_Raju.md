Sunil spent a brief time in the Schnable lab as a "bridge" postdoc between the completion of his PhD in 2017 and his move to Michigan State in 2018 as employee number one of the Niederhuth Lab. Sunil joined the lab with a strong background in molecular biology and field research and an interest in developing his bioinformatics and plant phenotyping skills. He left with both those new sets of skills and a new fascination with the grass *Tripsacum dactyloides* a wild relative of maize native to much of North America and which possesses the ability to overwinter.
