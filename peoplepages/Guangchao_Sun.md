Guangchao joined the lab in 2017 after completing his PhD in Plant Pathology where he studied a fungal pathogen called Magnaporthe oryzae which causes blast disease in both rice and wheat. In his PhD he focused on the role of Target Of Rapamycin (TOR) and autophagy during the infection of rice by M. oryzae. Over the past several years he has worked on a range of projects spanning genome annotation, abiotic stress tolerance in crop wild relatives, and GWAS for expression traits. He currently acts as the interface between the lab and the NSF funded CRRI project.
