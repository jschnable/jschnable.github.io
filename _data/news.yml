  summary: "Welcome, [Ryleigh Kirby](/peoplepages/RyleighK/), [Surya Krishna Sakthivel](/peoplepages/SuryaK/),
    and [Hira Aslam](/peoplepages/HiraA/). Hira joins us as a visiting PhD student from Pakistan who
    is studying the regulation of seed mineral content in maize. Surya is a rotating graduate student
    figuring out how to optimize maize photosynthesis using genomes of crop wild relatives. Ryleigh
    joined our lab as a high school student, continued as an undergrad, and is now a PhD student
    integrating high throughput leaf phenotyping with undergraduate science education."
